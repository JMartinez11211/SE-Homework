            <div class="Content"><p>In vintages of abundance, the beauty at Soda Canyon Ranch never ceases to astonish. Steady winter rains quenched the hillsides through the end of May. An impressive fruit set was the result of mild temperatures and ideal conditions through the spring, and long, warm summer days followed by cool evenings helped develop a balanced crop load. A leisurely season was met with calm anticipation as we waited patiently for the fruit to develop. Then, all at once, we quickly and diligently picked the remarkable bounty of vibrant and intense fruit, confirming that 2018 would long be remembered as a vintage of exceptional quality. </p></div>
